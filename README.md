## Hardware
Platform: Raspberry Pi 3
Linux Distro: ArchLinux ARM 

## Current development operating system
Ubuntu 18.04

## Software
Facial Recognization Software:	Python3.6.8 | OpenCV 3.2 | Python3-tk 3.6.8

## To run
```python
./Benchmark.sh <frames> <time> <interval> <faces>
```
  **frames** - number of frames to run for  
  **time** - time in seconds to run the benchmark for  
  **interval** - time in seconds between each benchmark output  
  **faces** - number of faces
